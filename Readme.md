# Stash
Stash is inspired by GNU Stow written in C.
Stash is made specially for me, and is therefore extremely experimental. 
Dont use it if you care about your files or if you want to experiment with it as well.
I'm not responsible for you deleteing your files.

## How to build
The project uses nob made by [Alexey Kutepov](https://github.com/rexim) and can be found [here](https://github.com/tsoding/musializer/blob/f106c92934172096ed6822b6b9b276410cd99a31/nob.h).
All you need to start is a c compiler
```console
cc -o nob nob.c
```
And then just run nob to build the project.
